# AppBlocker

**AppBlocker** is an application that allows you to **block selected apps** based on **custom user profiles**, designed to serve as a **basic parental control tool**.

---
## Features
- Create **custom profiles**.
- Each profile lets you:
    - Select a **list of apps** to block.
    - Set a **schedule** (days and time ranges) for when the apps will be locked.
    - Shows a lock screen when trying to open a blocked app.
    - Password protection to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Multiple active profiles** - now you can enable more than one profile at the same time.
- **Strict Mode** - prevents users from disabling or bypassing AppBlocker once active.
